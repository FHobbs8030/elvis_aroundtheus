## The Plans on improving this project are:

- More Animations
- Add Audio and Videos

## TO DO:

All comments in the code
    - This refers to any "green" verbage throughout your code that references that something needs changed or fixed.

All buttons should have type attributes
    - All but two of your buttons have a `type="button"`. Please add the type attribute to the rest of your buttons in your index.html

Card like button looks different from the mockup - please check all properties and don't forget to add hover state and pointer cursor
    - Your heart button css in cards.css file needs to be modified to match the figma.
    - On your newer code it appears that your heart button is styled correctly, please transition it to here.


Big space between the header and profile sections on 1280 viewport
    - you will need to use media screen to adjusted the spacing between the header and profile sections on "1280px".


Big height of the header section on 320 viewport
    - you will need to use media screen to adjusted the height of the header section on "320px".

Incorrect size and location of the header logo on 320 viewport


Header bottom line shouldn't have side spaces on 320 viewport


profile__add-button should be centered horizontally on 320 viewport


There are also some comments for improvement. They don’t mean that you’ve done anything wrong, but they’re things we wanted to point out that can help you further develop your skills
